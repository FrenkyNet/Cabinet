# Cabinet Database Package

Cabinet is a framework independant DBAL (DataBase Abstraction Layer).
The API is designed to be easy and very flexible.

For the time being I've got some examples in the `index.php` file.

## Goals

- Make it easy to connect and query a database.
- Support major SQL dialects.
- Supply a basic interface for interacting with NoSQL databases.
- Be framework independant, and easy to drop into a project without major configuration.

## Planned support

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- MongoDB
- CouchDB
